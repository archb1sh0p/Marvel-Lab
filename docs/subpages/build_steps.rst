Logging:
########

Steps to get logging set up:
****************************

If you plan on using Splunk/Jupyter Notebooks/OSQuery/Kolide - install the required scripts on the Ubuntu box first before setting up logging on the endpoints.


On Ubuntu box:
**************

1. Install Docker by following these steps, assuming you’re on Ubuntu: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository.
2. Install Docker Compose by following the documentation here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/.
3. On the Ubuntu machine download the Marvel-Lab repository.
4. Go into ``Marvel-Lab\Logging\splunk`` and run ``setup_logging.sh``.

**Note**: Only Ubuntu 22.04+ is supported for this script.


On Windows Workstation and DC:
******************************

**Note**: In order to recieve logs in Splunk, the ``setup_logging.sh`` script must have succeeded on the Logger box (Ubuntu).

1. Download the Marvel-Lab repository in the ``C:\`` directory. (If you
   downloaded the .zip of the repo, move the child folder to the
   C:\ directory and rename to ``Marvel-Lab``).
2. Go to KolideIP:8443, set up Username/Password. 
3. Set Organization Name to ``Marvel Lab``. You don't have to do the URL. When it shows you the fleet web address, press Submit, then Finish. 
4. Go into ``Marvel-Lab\Set-Logging`` and run ``Set-Logging.ps1``.

**Note:** The Sysmon configuration is up to date with version - 11.0.
FileDelete Events will only be logged within the
``\Downloads`` folder of each user. Deletions are saved within
the ``C:\ArchivedFiles`` folder.



On MacOS Workstation:
*********************
1. Run ``logging.sh``
2. During installation there will be some prompt that will need to be filled in when accepting the Splunk License. Exact steps are below: 
- Press Enter
- Press q
- Press y, then Enter
- Enter admin username/password of your choice (You might have to do this twice)
